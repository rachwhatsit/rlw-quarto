    "text": "👋\nHi, I’m Rachel Wilkerson. I’m a statistician, a writer, community advocate, and West Texan. \n🌀\nWhat are you about?\nMy favorite way to make new math is by listening to people describe the a problem and the root causes. One of my favorite models, staged trees, describes unfolding stories mathematically. Storytelling and deep listening produce models grounded in the realities people face.\nI love patterns. My research in physics started from watching turbulent swirls of tea in a cup of milk. I studied Complexity Science entranced by the emergent behavior of syncing fireflies and and flocking starlings. Doing a deep dive into the mathematics of these systems honed my ability to hear math in the people’s stories\nSo what does that actually look like?\nExpert elicitation tranforms human intuition into probabilistic models. This is especially useful when we want an aswer to a question that doesn’t have any data (Ex: How much will sea levels rise in the Hebrides? What are the chances pdfs corrupt in the National Archives?) We can also use it to map out a problem and create bespoke mathematical structures.\nSometimes careful listening means paying attention to what I think of as ‘little data.’\nSo many people I’ve worked with, both across town and\nThe people I’ve worked alongside have pu\nI work to design data systems and models rooted in the realities of what humans need to thrive.\npending\nCurrent data system are artifacts of systems that aren’t conducive to human thriving. \nBelieve that designing better data system is intrinsic to the future we want. \nThat there can be a turning towards grounded data systems\nAsking hard questions about who owns the data and why, and envisioning a system that returns sovereignty to the people who collected it. \n🧩\nWho else do you work with?\nI volunteered with the Data Kind scoping team and participated in Data Dives. I assessed data for the Birchall Trust through the RSS’s Statisticians for Society program (Strong recommend, great data feedback). I’ve developed and delivered trainings on causal inference for Data Science for Social Good. More recently, I ran a local training for non-profits on how to level-up in terms of data maturity.\nI find conversations about future design and scenarios thinking incredibly exciting.\n📦\nDo you write software?\nI’ve authored a package on Bayesian network diagnostics. I’m currently working on a software package that scales qualitative coding using a tree-based approach, and another that preventatively checks fairness of AI systems.\n🌌\nWhat’s the coolest dataset you’ve ever worked with?\nI spent the best summer of my life working at the McDonald Observatory with some globular cluster spectroscopy data. While living in the Davis Mountains, I learned to love vim (the best text editor), Firefly, and the dark swaths in the Milky Way.\n✍️\nWhat else do you write about?\nWhere the data ends the art picks up\nDear data and Stefanie posavec\nWomen in STEM\nScience in popular culture, counterfactuals in Shakespeare. I had a brief stint writing review for Folk Radio UK, the highlight of which was interviewing I’m With Her.\n \n🏊‍♀️\nWhat else?\nI’m an open water swimmer and an avid tea drinker.\n☕️"
