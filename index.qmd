👋

Hi, I’m Rachel Wilkerson. I’m a statistician, a writer, community advocate, and West Texan. 

🌀

**What are you about?**

My favorite way to make new math is by listening to people describe the a problem and the root causes. One of my favorite models, staged trees, describes unfolding stories mathematically. Storytelling and deep listening produce models grounded in the realities people face.

I love patterns. My entry point into physics research started from watching turbulent swirls of tea in a cup of milk. I studied [Complexity Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/courses/mathematicsofsystems/2023/) entranced by the emergent behavior of syncing fireflies and flocking starlings. Doing a deep dive into the mathematics of these systems focused my ability to see math in the people's stories.

🧩

**So what does that actually look like?**

Expert elicitation transforms human intuition into probabilistic models. This is especially useful when we want an answer to a question that doesn't have any data (Ex: How much will sea levels rise in the Hebrides? What are the chances pdfs corrupt in the National Archives?) We can also use it to map out a problem and create bespoke mathematical structures: basically translating a white board of arrows and post-it notes into a full probabilistic model.

Sometimes careful listening means paying attention to little data. I've worked as a data scientist in the civic sector for ten years. Some of the projects I've most enjoyed have dealt with comparativly small data sets: a carefully constructed survey of local radio listeners, pre and post survey data from a local crisis center.

I want to know what happens when we return the decision making process about the data to the source? I believe that designing human-centric data system is essential to future conducive to human thriving. I believe there can be a turning towards grounded data systems.

 

👩‍💻

**Who else do you work with?**

I volunteered with the Data Kind scoping team and participated in [Data Dives](https://www.datakind.org/join-us/volunteer/). I assessed data for a local crisis center through the RSS's [Statisticians for Society](https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/) program (Strong recommend). I've developed and delivered trainings on causal inference for [Data Science for Social Good](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/). I frequent the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) slack channel. More recently, I ran a local training for non-profits on how to level-up in terms of data maturity.

Recently, I joined the Data Science faculty at Baylor University as a Lecturer. I'm currently teaching intro courses to R and python.

**Do you write software?**

Together with my coauthors, I've authored a package on [Bayesian network diagnostics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bnmonitor/index.html). I'm (slowly but surely) working on a software package that scales qualitative coding using a tree-based approach.

🌌

**What’s the coolest dataset you’ve ever worked with?**

I spent the best summer of my life working at the [McDonald Observatory](https://mcdonaldobservatory.org/) with some globular cluster spectroscopy data. While living in the Davis Mountains, I learned to love vim (the best text editor), Firefly, and the dark bands in the Milky Way.

✍️

**What else do you write about?**

I love exploring topics at the intersection of data and art. For the Curator Magazine, I wrote about Stefanie Posavec's [Dear Data project](https://curator-magazine.ghost.io/dear-data-the-surprising-artistry-of-personal-data/), a [counterfactual twist](https://curator-magazine.ghost.io/auto-draft-2/) in *Taming of the Shrew*, and [the scientific method](https://curator-magazine.ghost.io/the-scientific-method-at-the-metroplex/) in *The Martian*. I had a brief stint writing reviews for Folk Radio UK, the highlight of which was interviewing *I'm with Her.* My work has also appeared in Verily Magazine and Comment Magazine.

**What else?**

I’m an open water swimmer and an avid tea drinker.
