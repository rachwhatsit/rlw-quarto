👋

Hi, I’m Rachel Wilkerson. I’m a statistician, a writer, community advocate, and West Texan.

**What are you about?**

My favorite way to make new math is by listening to people describe the a problem and the root causes. One of my favorite models, staged trees, describes unfolding stories mathematically. Storytelling and deep listening produce models grounded in the realities people face.

I love patterns. My entry point into physics reserach started from watching turbulent swirls of tea in a cup of milk. I studied Complexity Science entranced by the emergent behavior of syncing fireflies and flocking starlings. Doing a deep dive into the mathematics of these systems focused my ability to see math in the people's stories.

**So what does that actually look like?**

Expert elicitation tranforms human intuition into probabilistic models. This is especially useful when we want an answer to a question that doesn't have any data (Ex: How much will sea levels rise in the Hebrides? What are the chances pdfs corrupt in the National Archives?) We can also use it to map out a problem and create bespoke mathematical structures: basically translating a white board of arrows and post-it notes into a full probabilistic model.

Sometimes careful listening means paying attention to little data. I've worked as a data scientist in the civic sector for ten years. I've been lucky to work with people who have a good handle

, and often the work has required thinking about the data th the most satisfying projects I've worked on creates d so often the questions non-profits have needs a careful design of their in a flashy mode

So many people I've worked with, both across town and

The people I've worked alongside have pu

I work to design data systems and models rooted in the realities of what humans need to thrive.

Current data system are artifacts of systems that aren’t conducive to human thriving. 

Believe that designing better data system is intrinsic to the future we want. 

That there can be a turning towards grounded data systems

Asking hard questions about who owns the data and why, and envisioning a system that returns sovereignty to the people who collected it.

**Who else do you work with?**

I volunteered with the Data Kind scoping team and participated in Data Dives. I assessed data for the Birchall Trust through the RSS's Statisticians for Society program (Strong recommend, great data feedback). I've developed and delivered trainings on causal inference for Data Science for Social Good. More recently, I ran a local training for non-profits on how to level-up in terms of data maturity.

I find conversations about future design and scenarios thinking incredibly exciting.

📦

**Do you write software?**

I've authored a package on Bayesian network diagnostics. I'm currently working on a software package that scales qualitative coding using a tree-based approach, and another that preventatively checks fairness of AI systems.

🌌

**What’s the coolest dataset you’ve ever worked with?**

I spent the best summer of my life working at the McDonald Observatory with some globular cluster spectroscopy data. While living in the Davis Mountains, I learned to love vim (the best text editor), Firefly, and the dark bands in the Milky Way.

**What else do you write about?**

Where the data ends the art picks up\
Dear data and Stefanie posavec\
Women in STEM\
Science in popular culture, counterfactuals in Shakespeare. I had a brief stint writing review for Folk Radio UK, the highlight of which was interviewing I'm With Her.

🏊‍♀️

**What else?**

I’m an open water swimmer and an avid tea drinker.
